# To-Do List App

## Description

_Tier 2/Week9_

I was tasked with creating a to-do list app.  This was my first full stack app and I was excited to be able to implement all of the requirements in a weekend.  The app keeps track of a user's upcoming tasks and has options to mark the task as completed or to delete it entirely.  When a task is marked as completed, the DOM updates to show that the task is crossed off.  In the future, I would like to add the option to un-mark tasks if they are marked off accidentally.  It would also be cool to add the ability to re-order the tasks based on priority.
